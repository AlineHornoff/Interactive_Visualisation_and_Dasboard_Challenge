# IVD Challenge - Belly Button Biodiversity

In this challenge Belly Button Biodiversity is explored via Interactive Visualisation and Dashboard (IVD) creation utilising a Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonise human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Dashboard Contents:

* Dropdown to explore the data for each individual participant
* Horizontal Bar Chart featuring the top ten microbial species
* Bubble Chart featuring all microbial species
* Gauge of the weekly belly button wash frequency for each individual

## Repository Contents

* static - 
* index.html
* samples.json - contains raw data
